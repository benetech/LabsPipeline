When in a noisy restaurant it is sometimes very difficult to hear your table mates. Even if the restaurant isn't noisy but you have a large group of people you can really only talk to the people in close proximity to you. 

It would be great if we could build a telephone like conference system where everyone could hear everyone else and be able to communicate in larger groups even if the surroundings is noisy. 

Everyone has their cell phones and with headphones with mic's and noise cancelling technology a system could be designed to facilitate this. 

Sendero Group LLC received a small grant to research a prototype of this called ""Easy Listening"".

Not sure how we could help, but maybe there is some technology which could help repopulate the conch shell which is a major food source for the people of Bahama amongst others. 
This showed up in my Facebook feed and thought it was interesting problem that maybe could be solved. 

Here is a video and links to the conservation efforts already in place.

Labs Pipeline,IDEA-145,Field Payment Tracking App,Idea,On Our Radar,6/16/2016 16:10,6/16/2016 16:10,,0,,,,,,,,"Labs Team, 

Someone has just submitted an idea for the Labs Pipeline! 

Response: 
1. Whats your idea in a few sentences? Feel free to add links to background info as needed.  
Problem: Communicating and tracking field payment processes 
For local human rights defenders or those providing services to their projects, the fact they receive funding from US government or other international sources could be the most insecure element of their work. Implementers sending funds to project staff often rely on local agents to distribute payments, verify work completed and document monies have been received. Tracking such transactions in the field can be cumbersome and the paper trail required by accounting practices creates a security risk for those receiving funds. 
Potential Solution: Payment Assignment and Receipt App 
As a potential solution for verification in any field payment system, this app would facilitate communication of payment tasks to a field agent and verification of payment receipt by the specified recipients. The apps would not be a vehicle for funds, but rather a way to assign and document payment tasks. By eliminating paper receipts and enabling easy export to accounting systems the security of the process would be greatly enhanced. The apps could be based on secureApp Generator, allowing them to be highly customizable. A signature pad would be added as a new field type while additional inputs to verify receipt or conditions for payment could be included such as images or passwords. To facilitate communication with the field agent, the apps could integrate a task assignment module to assign payment dates, amounts, conditions etc. to individuals or their pseudonyms. The receiving administrative account would see completed payment task records as well as pending tasks each time the field agent connects to internet. The administrative account records would be searchable, and could be summarized to report totals, payment history etc. Reports could be exported in formats compatible with bookkeeping systems while maintaining sensitive information separate and secure. 

2. How much social impact do you think this idea could have? Select one.  
Moderate impact

Problem: Replacing printed material that puts readers and distributors at risk 
Human Rights organizations we spoke with identified the distribution of printed material as the most dangerous part of their work. Printers, distributors and readers are put at risk by having the physical copy of subversive or independently created content. 

Potential Solution: Digital media sharable offline 
This idea would shift the content of news or fan zines to digital form passable to others via local wifi or Bluetooth (for example using Zapya or other such peer to peer sharing app that enables transfer from one mobile phone to another). The app would not replace the many software available to design digital content but rather serve as a platform to securely store it on one's device and share it with others. The move to digital form would could also facilitate more interaction such as allowing for reader comments and mechanisms send analytics or opinions to creators.

Problem: Transferring large files out of areas of limited internet access 
As multimedia capture of important human rights content becomes more common and grows in the volume, activists increasingly face challenges securely saving, organizing and sharing such content so that it can be used to advance their cause. This is particularly the case for those working in Cuba where the time and expense required to upload or physically transport large files is a barrier. 

Potential Solution: File Courier App and Web Interface 
This app would allow large files to be transferred from those without access to internet connection to those with access and would shift payment for file upload to the receiver. By using anonymous segmented file transfer over local WiFi, anyone with the app becomes a courier. Large data files can be imported to the app, where they are then broken into encrypted, transferable pieces with their destination user specified. Anyone with the app connects anonymously with other app users on the same WiFi network or within a certain physical range using local WiFi or Bluetooth connections. At connections, file segments are transferred based on user settings. Anyone could be a sender or collector. When collectors connect to the internet, they upload the segments they have retrieved and receive the corresponding portion of the reward for each file.

On any given day hundreds to tens of thousands of people leave their homes, leaving virtually everything behind. They may choose to leave due to economic uncertainty, or they may be forced from their homes by famine, war, disease, ethnic 'cleansing,' or poverty. Often, these people are poor; almost always they leave out of desperation, knowing that survival is more likely away from their home. 
During their journey, inevitably, families get split up. Mothers and children are sent ahead and fathers are left behind, or children are sent by a parent to a remote location to meet another parent for their safety. Benetech could build an application (database) that could reconnect these broken families. However, the database would have to represent families through a token or otherwise obscure a name or location. For example, earlier this year there were thousands of children that came across the border from Mexico. Many of them had family in the US, but often that family member was undocumented. Helping those children reunite with their parents would help the family (and the US Gov't) but the family isn't going to expose themselves to the INS and risk deportation. If they could communicate anonymously with a token representing their identity, they could safely reunite.
