IDEA-58,Family Relocation-reconnection unification tool,On Our Radar,4/25/2016 11:52,"AKA FRRUT. On any given day hundreds to tens of thousands of people leave their homes, leaving virtually everything behind. They may choose to leave due to economic uncertainty, or they may be forced from their homes by famine, war, disease, ethnic 'cleansing,' or poverty. Often, these people are poor; almost always they leave out of desperation, knowing that survival is more likely away from their home. 
During their journey, inevitably, families get split up. Mothers and children are sent ahead and fathers are left behind, or children are sent by a parent to a remote location to meet another parent for their safety. Benetech could build an application (database) that could reconnect these broken families. However, the database would have to represent families through a token or otherwise obscure a name or location. For example, earlier this year there were thousands of children that came across the border from Mexico. Many of them had family in the US, but often that family member was undocumented. Helping those children reunite with their parents would help the family (and the US Gov't) but the family isn't going to expose themselves to the INS and risk deportation. If they could communicate anonymously with a token representing their identity, they could safely reunite. This is repeated regularly (Syria is the latest). http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2015/10/world/dadaab-refugees/?utm_source=nextdraft&utm_medium=email"

While the study was not able to pinpoint the exact cause, one plausible theory is those kids that have been exposed to enriched experiences like travel achieve higher outcomes then their peers who do not. One way to think about closing the gap is to provide similar opportunities to all children. While taking millions of kids worldwide on trips of a lifetime is not a realistic solution, I am curious how incorporating virtual reality explorations into the curriculum can help kids experience the Civil War (for example) by not only reading about it but actually being there.

Furthermore, about 230 million people are at risk, and the disease causes $8 billion in losses annually. 

The good news: the infection is treatable by antibiotics and, in some cases, surgery. To be treated however, communities have to wait for health workers to reach them with treatments, which can take quite a while.

Too often mobile phones and tablets can create a barrier and trust issues especially in technology-poor or sensitive environments. Can we create an audio capture device that unobtrusively captures the interaction, and is the crowd transcribed with near zero-knowledge conveyed to the transcriber (maybe sending only a few words)."
IDEA-33,Safe Passage for data In narrow-band environments,On Our Radar,4/25/2016 11:01,"A torrent-inspired mesh networking solution. A file in broken into chunks and chunks are encrypted with a private key. Other users can designate themselves as a data-carrier, carriers will silently receive chunks of this data that can be uploaded to a repo when they next connect to the internet. The app ensure safe and equal distribution of file chunks. Over time all file chunks would be received and the file is successfully and securely crowdsourced to the cloud."
IDEA-32,Video management and processing for human rights,Exploratory,4/25/2016 10:58,"Video management and processing system with these components: 
Create a central repo for the collection, processing, and search of timecoded tags for videos. This repo can aggregate tags generated by machines or humans and can help searchers connect to the organization holding the source video. Animated word clouds of the timecoded labels can also be generated. 

A human rights organization can upload a bowdlerized video or video frames which can be distributed on an online platform for geoidentification. Similar to GeoGuesser, the crowd will pick the estimated location from a map and the aggregate/average location will by offered to the original uploader"" 

Platform that allows human rights organizations to add descriptive metadata and tags to their media and submit that data to a searchable repository. In this manner organizations can share details amongst partners without exposing the source media. A human rights organization can upload a bowdlerized video or video frames which can be distributed on an online platform for geoidentification. Similar to GeoGuesser, the crowd will pick the estimated location from a map and the aggregate/average location will by offered to the original uploader"

IDEA-28,In Kind Donation Tracking,On Our Radar,4/25/2016 10:48,"When tools/goods are donated, how does the rationing work? The article notes a lending library, but who manages the time allotted for use, wait list, prioritization, etc.? Or when there are objects that users get to keep (e.g. tooth brushes, food, clothes, shoes, etc.), how do we ensure resources (goods) are evenly distributed across a community? Or alternatively, when funds are donated for disaster relief, who/how do people determine what to purchase for a community? What tools are being used to manage all this?"
IDEA-27,Help activists to fill out strict reporting forms,Exploratory,4/25/2016 10:45,"From David B. , Design an easy to use interface into which activists can enter sections of relevant data.

IDEA-26,In Plain Sight Markov Chain Driven Encryption,Early Stage,4/25/2016 10:43,Utilizing markov-chain logic and an agreed upon body of literature + passphrase to encrypt text into human readable text. Ex) The phrase 'meet me at eight' when run through Shakespeare encryption may read 'Whether it is far nobler to be or not to be'. This text can be posted as plain text to any technology platform (or physical medium) and network filtering/monitoring wouldn't know to be suspect of it.

IDEA-18,3D Printing for Health Education,Early Stage,4/25/2016 10:16,"Use 3D printing to meet needs of students requiring 3d models for health/reproductive education (e.g., students who are blind or have other disabilities). Kids with visual impairments have trouble accessing pictures and video. Although image descriptions and captioning help, hands on exploration of objects is the ideal way to learn especially in sex education. Researchers at Northern Illinois University have been focused on this issue for some time but think that 3D models will address the gap picture representation and very expensive anatomical models. NIU can consult on what TVIs need to educate blind kids around sex ed but they do not have the resources to design, distribute or store these models in a repository. Additionally this work could be used in developing countries. Lots to explore.
